# conquer-template-recreation

## Goal
I created a purely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with some jQuery) recreation of a Bootstrap template found at https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer.

## Experience Gained
The project allowed me to gain further experience with:

* mobile responsive layout using a 12-column style similar to Bootstrap,
* Parallax effects,
* navigation menu styling and effects (including on mobile),
* and improving upon an existing design.

## Summary

Overall, this project turned out to be a great website design recreation that let me exercise those front-end skills.
